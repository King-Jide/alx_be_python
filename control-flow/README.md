# Python Control Flow Projects

Welcome to my Python learning repository!

This repository contains a collection of beginner-level Python programs developed to solidify my understanding of **control flow** and demonstrate how Python can be used to **automate repetitive tasks**.

## í´¹ Projects Included

### 1. Weather Recommendation Program
A program that provides clothing or activity suggestions based on current weather conditions using conditional logic.

### 2. Simple Calculator (Using `match-case`)
A basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations by utilizing Pythonâ€™s `match-case` statement introduced in Python 3.10.

### 3. Multiplication Table Generator
Automatically generates a multiplication table using nested loops.

### 4. Personal Daily Reminder
A customizable reminder tool that outputs daily tasks or messages to help structure your day.

## í·  Skills Demonstrated

These projects showcase my application of:

- âœ… `match-case` logic control  
- âœ… Nested `for` and `while` loops  
- âœ… Conditional statements for decision making  
- âœ… Automation of simple, repetitive tasks
